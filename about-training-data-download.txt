# Project will download training data.
# aclImdb_v1.tar.gz, approx 85 MB.
# The unzipped dir struct is about 300MB. So total it is about 400MB, but you could delete the zip, I guess.
# The aclImdb/ directory structure is just an area data is read from.
# It is not a workspace or output area.

# The project and tensorflow/keras usage in the python code expect a directory/data-structure like this:

main_directory/
...class_a/
......a_text_1.txt
......a_text_2.txt
...class_b/
......b_text_1.txt
......b_text_2.txt

# This download has been tested with this code, and it all works in the same way with the same results as the Collab
# created from the tutorial code.
