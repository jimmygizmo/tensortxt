All I have under ~/.keras is one small JSON file.  (Early in usage.)

~/.keras/keras.json
* And it is missing a newline on the last line. cat and tail show a warning character for this.
* vi and webstorm (json default) do not clearly show the missing NL.
* So something in Keras is writing malformed JSON files (for prefs and maybe more.)

}

* I did not show cat's missing final ML warning character here, which shows to the right of the final }
