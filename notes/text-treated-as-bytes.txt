Just a curiosity which might be very relevant if Unicode ever needs to be processed.
It looks like internally the text is being stored as bytes .. meaning like ASCII of the old days of strings.

Notice the b'some text' inside the tensor object.

tf.Tensor(b'Great movie - especially the music - Etta James - "At Last". This speaks volumes when you have finally
found that special someone.', shape=(), dtype=string)

If we know our input can be converted to ascii/bytes with no problem, then this is a great optimization.
But we would need to handle Unicode or something else or something similar if it was anything more than
ASCII bytes in the text data.

I think we have to be explict in either case and make this clear everywhere.
